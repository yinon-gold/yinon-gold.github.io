* B.Sc. in Computer Science in the AI track, Technion, grad. 2023. Took advanced courses in deep learning, computer vision, NLP, data processing, computer architecture for ML

Projects
======
* Project in Deep Learning - Implemented novel deep learning methods and improved an article on patch adversarial attacks for neural networks in visual odometry, guided by VISTA Lab at Technion's CS faculty.
* Datathlon in Biomedical Engineering – With a team of 5, developed a data pipeline and deployed classical ML models to predict patient outcomes and ICU stay period of COVID ICU patients at Rambam. Presented the results in front of medical and faculty staff.
* COVID-19 Prediction Model – Created, trained, and tested a regression model for predicting a COVID-19 variant type, using patients’ information.
Won 4th place out of 47 teams at the Intro to ML course’s mini-project competition.
