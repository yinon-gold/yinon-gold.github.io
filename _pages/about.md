I am a Computer Science Master's student at the Technion, doing my thesis "Predicting Pathological Response to Radiotherapy Treatment in Colorectal Cancer Patients Using Deep Learning" under the supervision of [Prof. Assaf Schuster](https://assaf.net.technion.ac.il/).

I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, in the AI track, at the Technion, during which I served as Chairperson of the CS student committee.

During my B.Sc, I interned at [Habana Labs](https://habana.ai/) as a student software developer, and at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) as a student software engineer.

My main areas of interest are: computer vision, transformer architechtures for massive data processing, and personalized healthcare.
